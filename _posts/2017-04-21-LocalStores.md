### TL:DR The Fact That Online Stores Are Shutting Local Stores Down

It has been common today to dismiss the fact of local businesses growing in the last decade. Local businesses for the past decade have slowly been struggling due to the advancements that technology has brought to the world. Why would technology affect local businesses? Well because of advancements in technology, you can buy almost anything online from big chain stores on their websites or from the largest online store which is Amazon ("How does the Entry of Large Discount Stores Increase Retail Employment? Evidence from Korea."). Amazon is an online store that customers have a huge variety to buy products. Online stores are just like regular stores, but the difference is you can purchase from the comfort of your home and just wait a couple of days for delivery. The reason why online stores weren't big a decade ago was due that technology wasn't fully caught up with the current day events, the prices for products online were overpriced, and delivery would take to long that people didn’t have the patience to wait a couple of days for their product.

The reason why online stores are growing is due to supply and demand ("Managing Demand and Supply Uncertainties to Achieve Mass Customization Ability."). Supply and demand are the effects the availability of a particular product, and the desire for that product has on the price ("Managing Demand and Supply Uncertainties to Achieve Mass Customization Ability."). That relates to online stores because in today’s world you can buy almost everything online except certain types of food for the most part. That means any supply or product you want for example Amazon could get you with just one click of a button. Also, for instance, Amazon has made it easier for their customers with Amazon prime which is an account you pay a little amount of money per month to get discounts, faster shipping, and cheaper shipping. That has hurt local businesses because a person can get the same product cheaper, faster forms of delivery, and at home instead of wasting time to go to the store.
Local businesses usually don’t have an online store, or if they do, they usually wouldn’t have delivery. That impacts a customer has is big time because a local business wouldn’t reach as much of the world, for example, Amazon which is a global online store(“Global Vs. Local-the Hungarian Retail Wars”). Also, local businesses would only have a limited amount of stores which would only cover certain amounts of territory in a region. That would make customers travel far distances to get certain items that the local stores might not have anymore depending on the time of the year and the particular product (“Global Vs. Local-the Hungarian Retail Wars”). By only having a couple of stores that only covers a particular region makes it tough for customers to get your product from their stores. Doesn’t mean that local businesses don’t have good products, but it is hard when customers can only get their products in the particular region. Whereas Amazon offers the opportunity to get the same product online and it could be delivered all across the world.

Other advantages online stores have over local stores is working capacity. What do you mean online stores have the better working position? Doesn’t Online stores does it own work. Well, the right answer is that online stores need a lot more workers than local stores because you have to maintain the service. Also, add new products daily, updating the website daily, having people work in the service department in case any customers need help, and lastly online stores need a lot of delivery workers that adds up to a lot of employees (“Global Vs. Local-the Hungarian Retail Wars”). Whereas, local stores only need a couple of workers per day to run their store.

Yes, who doesn’t love cute little local stores that make their products? For example, a Christmas ornament shop that is a lovely store but the fact is customers would have to travel far distances. With a store with one theme, and the prices are proudly higher due to the fact they are handmade ornaments and would only be able to be sold during Christmas time. My point is it is just easier to buy stuff online these days to the impact technology has had by making it faster and quicker.
