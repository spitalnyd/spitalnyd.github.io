### TL:DR The Olympics changed throughout history

  The Olympics is the worlds biggest sporting events where the best athletes fight
to compete for a gold medal in their respectful events.The Olympics games has the
Winter games and the Summer games which are every four years and are 2 years apart.
The concept of the Olympics or bringing the best athletes around the world to compete
in event for example swimming, running, and etc. The Olympics was created in ancient
Greece to honor Zeus. They did different events like for example like horse racing,
sprinting,chariot racing,combat like wrestling and boxing. They also would get a
olive wreath if they win unlike today you will get an gold medal. So over history
from ancient Greece to current time technology has effected Olympic standard.

  Technology was really poor when the games was first invented. Meaning unlike today
you can't see every event get televise on TV you would have to be be their. Also
the stadiums during the first Olympics to now weren't really the same because back
than they did almost every event in the same spot whereas today each event pretty
much has their own stadium where fans can go watch their favorite athletes compete.
It cost about 3 billion dollars for the current Olympics host because they have to
have world class stadiums, transportations and places for the guest or fans to live.
For example by hosting the Olympics it leads to the country going in to further debt.
But because of the change of technology it allows for every athlete to have the best
gear to compete for their event and at the same time it allows for any fan to stream
the Olympics wherever like on their computers, TV, phones, tablets, and etc.

  The technology also have changed for every event because for swimming they have
invented underwater cameras to stream the action, also at the same time have radar
that paces how face every athlete is going for every like lap at the same time comparing
it too the world record. In ancient Greek for the running events the races was started
by a gun whereas today we have sensors with the start off gun to check if their was any
false starts also there is a speaker behind each runner to hear the gun more clearly.
Another event that technology impacted was tennis where people use to play with a wooden
racquet's and on a lawn is now played with the most diverse and engineered racquet's that
are lighter and faster at the same time having their own stadium. Archery was also changed by
technology where their use to be and paper target now today we have a sensor filled
target to get the accurate spot for every hit. The invention of sensors has impacted
a lot of other sports too like soccer and hockey where it is at the goal line where
it is measure to see when a ball or puck crosses the line to go in the net. Their
has been more technological changes to the events in the Olympics to make it easier
for the athletes with gear, easier for the judges or referees with sensors that give
you instant electrical data, and also made it easier for every person or fan to watch
the Olympics from every angle or any place with the use of the Internet.

  The Olympics today wouldnâ€™t be the same without the big impact of technology because
their would be no way to watch every event, to get the most accurate call for every
event possible, or to even compete at your highest ability without the best gear.
Through the process that went from an event in one country to the biggest worldwide
sporting event in the world where a lot of fans and athletes all over the world come
to watch or compete in the historic Olympic games. As the Olympics continues in the
future it will only get more technically sound and improved with the impact of technology.
