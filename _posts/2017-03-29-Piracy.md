### TL:DR Interesting real life facts of Piracy

Have you ever got in trouble with digital piracy? You might have never heard of digital piracy. So let me update you digital piracy is when you illegally download or copy music, movies, computer software, apps, games, and etc. So why did I ask you if you ever have got in trouble with digital piracy because although many people may consider it file sharing or borrowing or free, digital piracy it is a serious issue, it carries many consequences, and it is illegal ("Risks of using Pirated Software."). It might seem like innocent act and you're not doing anything too bad, but the discount, or the free games, music, computer software, and apps you are getting from the internet or a friend who has downloaded the so called items, is theft, and it is against licensing terms by most of the  companies who produce computer software, music, movies, apps, or games. By pirating these items you might not realize but it causes the prices to go up for customers who pay for those items. It also affects businesses and companies according to the Business Software Alliance, software theft from digital piracy costs Industry’s $51 billion dollars in 2009 ("What Is the Effect of Piracy on a Business?" ). Also, piracy diverts money away from producers and distributors of items such as audio recordings and music, making those companies who make an investment in production and distribution work harder and make less profit ("Music Piracy: Major Studies Conflicted Over Recording Industry Impact.").
Some of the consequences of getting caught by doing digital piracy may include having lawsuits against you by the company that you copyright or stole from, risks of losing a job, or getting thrown out of school for unethical behavior, having to repay the cost of the pirated software, and plus any other costs if you are actually sued by a company for having stolen their property ("Risks of using Pirated Software."). Also, if it is that bad you could go to jail depending on what or how much you pirated. Even if you don’t get caught, pirating can still have a negative effect to the user. You might ask what do I mean? What I mean is you can get a high possibility of having viruses on the software that can cause future damage on your computer or device like having an entire hard drive wiped out, depending on what is contained in the pirated software or item "Risks of using Pirated Software.". Also, that will allow not getting any of the latest virus updates and program updates, due to the fact that you are not connecting to the internet that is pirated for the only use of the program.
