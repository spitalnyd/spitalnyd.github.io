### TL:DR Interesting real life facts of Piracy

Digital piracy is when you illegally download like for example software, music, movies, apps, and textbooks. In terms, it compares to stealing because you are getting things for free illegally. But to get more information on the topic I interviewed a current student at Allegheny college. The reason I chose to interview this student because he has a history with digital piracy that goes deeper than the definition of digital piracy. I asked my interviewer a couple questions to give me a better output on the negatives and positives of digital piracy. I first asked him what does digital piracy means to you? He replied joking saying free things like software to help my computer run at the highest ability when I online game, to get music, and of course to get free games. The next question I asked him was how much money do you think you have saved from piracy? My interview then made a face expression that would shock anybody as he then said I have about pirated and saved about 5000 dollars worth of equipment for my standards. When I was analyzing this I realize one of the positives was the amount of money you can save about pirating things because you donâ€™t have to pay money and just download music, software, movies, and etc.
