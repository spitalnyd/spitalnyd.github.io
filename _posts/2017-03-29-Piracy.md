### TL:DR How piracy can negatively effect your life with either getting fined money, going to jail, losing opportunities and having self regrets

Have you ever got in trouble with digital piracy? You might have never heard of digital piracy. So let me update you digital piracy is when you illegally download or copy music, movies, computer software, apps, games, etc. So why did I ask you if you ever have got in trouble with digital piracy because although many people may consider it file sharing or borrowing or free, digital piracy it is a serious issue, it carries many consequences, and it is illegal ("Risks of using Pirated Software."). It might seem like the innocent act, and you're not doing anything too bad, but the discount, or the free games, music, computer software, and apps you are getting from the internet or a friend who has downloaded the so called items, is theft. Will be against licensing terms by most of the companies who produce computer software, music, movies, apps, or games. By pirating these items, you might not realize, but it causes the prices to go up for customers who pay for those things. It also affects businesses and companies according to the Business Software Alliance, software theft from digital piracy costs Industry’s $51 billion dollars in 2009 ("What Is the Effect of Piracy on a Business?" ). Also, piracy diverts money away from producers and distributors of items such as audio recordings and music, making those companies who make an investment in production and distribution work harder and make less profit ("Music Piracy: Major Studies Conflicted Over Recording Industry Impact.").

Some of the consequences of getting caught by doing digital piracy may include having lawsuits against you by the company that you copyright or stole from. A company sues risks of losing a job or getting thrown out of school for unethical behavior, having to repay the cost of the pirated software, and plus any other expenses for having stolen their property ("Risks of using Pirated Software."). Also, if it is that bad, you could go to jail depending on what or how much you pirated. Even if you don’t get caught, pirating can still have an adverse effect to the user. You might ask what do I mean? What I mean is you can get a high possibility of having viruses on the software that can cause future damage to your computer or the device like having an entire hard drive wiped out, depending on what contains pirated software or items "Risks of using Pirated Software.". Also, that will allow not getting any of the latest virus updates and program updates, because you are not connecting to the internet that is pirated for the only use of the program. To give you a better look and more information on the adverse effects of digital piracy I have recently interviewed a student from Allegheny College named Tage Boggs. The reason I talked with this particular student was that he had a history of digital piracy.

**Q: How did you get into digital piracy?**
A: Well back in high school I found out from a friend he was getting free music and games. So I asked him how he got it. He later gave me this site to pirate music

**Q: Did you only pirated music?**

A: No! After doing some research, I found out other things to pirate like movies, games, apps and software.

**Q: How Easy is it to pirate items?**

A: He started to laugh and said I would legit go to the site and download the thing I wanted.

**Q: How long did it take to download these items?**

A: It depended on the issue like movies, music, and apps took seconds to download. The games would take a little longer because I would have to transfer the game to the disc so it would take me like 15-20 minutes. The software took forever like between 30 minutes to 2 hours because of the variety and variables it brings to the system.

**Q: Approximately how much items have you pirated?**

A: He was starting laughing again. Then said you might not believe me, but I have at least pirated about 10 thousand dollars worth of stuff.

**Q: Have you ever got caught?**

A: Sadly I had and paid a high price in many ways because of it.

**Q: What was the consequence for getting caught?**

A: Well first off my mom found out and got in big trouble with family. I then had to pay back the amount of money I took from this particular company. Lastly, I got suspended from high school for unusual activity.

**Q: Do you still use digital piracy?**

A: No not anymore I have learned my lesson.

**Q: What was the lesson you have learned?**

A: Well I learned a life lesson like I have a mark on my record that made it hard to go to colleges, get possible internships and jobs. When I got caught I just felt bad for everything I took and the companies and people I affected.

**Q: Do you have any advice to give to people?**

A: Just don’t pirate yes it might be free at the moment but will be paying for it later!

The conclusion of this article is to warn you about digital piracy. Digital piracy on the outside might seem productive because you can get free stuff and items. But in reality, piracy is atrocious and can lead to adverse effects like earlier discussed in the article result in fines, jail, and costing you chances at future job and opportunities. So when your thinking of doing digital piracy ask you this question is it worth all the consequences or harm you could bring to your life?
