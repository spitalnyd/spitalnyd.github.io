### TL:DR Negatives Of Google Help

  Google Help is a appilcation that can be found online, on a google account, or device.
The whole point of google help is when you have a problem for example like with your
android you can go to google help to fix the problem or to help you understand how
the products works. That was the whole idea of this appilcation was to get help
if you need it and the computer tells you how to fix it and if that's not clear enough
their is a phone number to call and the a representive from google will try to help
you step by step. So from the outskirts meaning from the outside the google help
application looks really useful,easy and understanding but don't judge a book by it's
cover. The google help application is actually really complicated and at times could make it harder than it has to be to figure out your problem.
