### TL:DR Negatives Of Google Help

Google Help is an application that can be found online, on a google account or device.
The whole point of google help is when you have a problem, for example, like with your
android you can go to google help to fix the problem or to help you understand how
the products work. That was the whole idea of this application was to get help
if you need it and the computer tells you how to fix it and if that's not clear enough
there is a phone number to call and a representative from google will try to help
you step by step. So from the outskirts meaning from the outside, the google help
application looks really useful, easy and understanding but don't judge a book by its
cover. The google help application is actually really complicated and at times could make it harder than it has to be to figure out your problem.

  One example why google help can be a frustrating application to use is because it might not answer your question. You can type in a question and sometimes the application
will not have any idea what your talking about and pull up an idea that doesn't relate to your idea at all. I guess that happens and then it allows you to call a number
if you haven't fixed your problem relating to google. Again this seems nice to have somebody talk you through the solution to the problem. But the issues is first off not having enough people on staff so sometimes you will have to wait a long time for customer server of the google help application just to help you. Another issue is finally when your google representative get's to you, it could be hard either understanding each other depending on the sounds of the voice or accents that could be hard to understand.
So when your talking to the representative trying to help you there is a good possible chance he might not understand what your talking about or you the user might have a
the tough time following his instructions making the situation more complicated than it needs to be but at the same time you might not even get the solution to your problem and
could have wasted a lot of time on the phone trying to figure it out.

  Another example that show's why the application of google help is complicated to use
like the phone call issue is the email idea. There are pro and cons of the google help search doesn't give you a solution to help your problem. That is either calling the google help center or emailing them your problem. So like the phone call the email
can be just as confusing and frustrating. Meaning you can email the google help application and it could take a couple of hours to a couple of days to answer your
question and there will be a chance that they didn't help you answer your question completely. Meaning it could take a lot of time going back and forth emailing each other
and still be confused meaning that they or you didn't understand the question or instructions or just the fact it's hard to explain what to do when you are not in person
giving them instructions on how to solve the problem. It just really frustrating to explain every step and knowing you might have to start over.

  At the end of the day google help seems like a could concept to help you with your
problems but it just hard, for the most part, to have the computer or the google advisor
help you with your problem through this technology just because it can have a lot
of frustrations with either communication being off, taking a lot of time, or even
mentally frustrating you to the point where you just give up. There is just to flaws
in the application not just with getting help through calling or emailing but also by searching your problem in the google help app because most of the time it will give your suggestions on any other topic except the one you need help with. Google help
is still a productive app but there is a lot of flaws in the application that can be fixed.Mostly the communication and solution part of the application. Like listed before really the main issue with the application that might make it hard for people to use is the communication and finding and knowing where everything on the application is and could be. So if they just make some small changes to improve the communication and service of the application and maybe open some more local stores like apple where you can go get help in person.
