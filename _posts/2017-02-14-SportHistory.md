TL: DR The Olympics Changed Throughout History

The Olympics is the world's biggest sporting events where the best athletes fight to compete for a gold medal in their respectful events.The Olympics games have the Winter games and the Summer games which are every four years and are 2 years apart. The concept of the Olympics or bringing the best athletes around the world to compete in the event, for example, swimming, running, and etc. The Olympics was created in ancient Greece to honor Zeus. They did different events like for examples like horse racing, sprinting, chariot racing, combat like wrestling and boxing. They also would get an olive wreath if they win unlike today you will get a gold medal. So over history from ancient Greece to current time technology has affected Olympic standard.

The technology was really poor when the games were first invented. Meaning unlike today you can't see every event get televise on TV you would have to be-be theirs. Also, the stadiums during the first Olympics to now weren’t really the same because back then they did almost every event in the same spot whereas today each event pretty much has their own stadium where fans can go watch their favorite athletes compete. It cost about 3 billion dollars for the current Olympics host because they have to have world class stadiums, transportations and places for the guest or fans to live. For example, by hosting the Olympics it leads to the country going into further debt. But because of the change of technology, it allows for every athlete to have the best gear to compete for their event and at the same time, it allows for any fan to stream the Olympics wherever like on their computers, TV, phones, tablets, and etc.

The technology also has changed for every event because for swimming they have invented underwater cameras to stream the action, also at the same time have radar that places how to face every athlete is going for every like lap at the same time comparing it to the world record. In ancient Greek, for the running events, the races were started by a gun whereas today we have sensors with the start off the gun to check if there were any false starts also there is a speaker behind each runner to hear the gun more clearly. Another event that technology impacted was tennis where people use to play with wooden racquets and on a lawn is now played with the most diverse and engineered racquets that are lighter and faster at the same time having their own stadium. Archery was also changed by technology where their use to be and paper target now today we have a sensor-filled target to get the accurate spot for every hit. The invention of sensors has impacted a lot of other sports too like soccer and hockey where it is at the goal line where it is a measure to see when a ball or puck crosses the line to go in the net. There have been more technological changes to the events in the Olympics to make it easier for the athletes with gear, easier for the judges or referees with sensors that give you instant electrical data, and also made it easier for every person or fan to watch the Olympics from every angle or any place with the use of the Internet.

The Olympics today wouldn’t be the same without the big impact of technology because there would be no way to watch every event, to get the most accurate call for every event possible, or to even compete at your highest ability without the best gear. Through the process that went from an event in one country to the biggest worldwide sporting event in the world where a lot of fans and athletes all over the world come to watch or compete in the historic Olympic games. As the Olympics continues in the future it will only get more technically sound and improved with the impact of technology.
